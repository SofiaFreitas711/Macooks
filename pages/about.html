        <p class="text-[#3E2C1B]"> MaCooks has two meanings: 1) Mamas cooks and 2) Ma (as mine) cooks. This website is a full catalog of recipes that can taste just like mom cooks just put some love into it and happiness, and mom will be proud of her little chef.</p>

        <h3 class="my-5 text-xl font-bold text-[#3E2C1B]">MaCooks little mission</h3>
        <p class="text-[#3E2C1B]">Childhood meals were amazing, prepared with love by parents, grandparents, and family, filling us with warmth. However, as we grow, our relationship with food can become complicated. What was once delightful sometimes turns into something daunting. But that's not true! Food is incredible; it's the fuel for our bodies, providing the energy to accomplish wonderful things. Here at MaCooks, we want to remind everyone of this truth. We aim to assist those facing food challenges by sharing stories and offering support because we've been through it too.</p>
